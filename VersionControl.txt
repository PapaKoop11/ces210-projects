Version Control explanation by Michael Wynkoop


Version Control is a system to allow the tracking of changes made to your code and/or other
files. It also allows for members of a team to coordinate their projects.

One of the benefits of Version Control is keeping a history of changes that are made. Different people can be 
working on their own branch of a project without impacting other team members code. This allows for better 
collaboration. Once you know your code works locally, it can then be shared safely.

Version Control works well when there are several people working on the same project. A project manager can 
incorporate a change from a branch to see how it affects the overall project. Several team mates could have 
different approaches. Using a distributed version control system like git being served on GitHub.com, those 
approaches can be tested without having to break the main program.

The command "git clone -name-of-the-repositiory" will create a copy of the project named name-of-the-repositiory
which is located on GitHub.com onto your local computer.
